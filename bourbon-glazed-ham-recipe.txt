1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups water
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple rings

Directions:
1.Score the surface of the ham, making diamond shapes about 1/2-inch deep. Place
the ham in a large, resealable bag. Add the bourbon, brown sugar, crushed pineapple,
honey, and garlic to the bag; refrigerate at least 8 hours, turning the bag over
several times while marinating.
2.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3.Transfer the ham and marinade to a large baking dish; pour the water into the dish.
Attach the pineapple rings around the surface of the ham with toothpicks.
4.Bake in preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (95
degrees C), basting occasionally with the sauce in the pan, 90 to 105 minutes.
